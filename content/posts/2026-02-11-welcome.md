# Welcome to My New Website

I'm excited to announce the launch of my new personal website! This site is built with a minimalistic approach, focusing on content and ease of use.

## What's New?

### Clean Design

The website features a clean, minimalistic design with:

- Generous white space for better readability
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Clear typography and comfortable line spacing

### Powerful Search

One of the standout features is the **large, prominent search bar** at the top of every page. You can quickly find any content across all blog posts and pages using keywords.

### Easy Content Management

All content is written in Markdown and stored in the repository. To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.md` file in `content/posts/`
2. Use the naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Add YAML front matter with title, date, and tags
4. Write your content in Markdown
5. Push to GitHub - the site rebuilds automatically!

## Built With

- **Pandoc**: Converts Markdown to beautiful HTML
- **Lunr.js**: Powers the client-side search functionality
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, reliable hosting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatic deployment on every push

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

- Web development techniques and best practices
- Technology thoughts and reviews
- Personal projects and experiments

Stay tuned for more content!
