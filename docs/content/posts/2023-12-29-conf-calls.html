      <h1 id="conf-calls-static-link-how-to">Conf-calls static link: How
      to?</h1>
      <h2 id="zooms-personal-meeting-room">Zoom’s Personal Meeting
      Room</h2>
      <p>I love Zoom’s Personal Meeting Room: every user has a dedicated
      url link that is permanent and never changing. I can then use it,
      share it, email it, write it over and over, e.g. upfront on email
      signatures, on recurring calendar shared events, in online
      appointment booking systems (like <a
      href="https://www.giugliano.info/cv/blog/quick-confcall-link/calendly.com">Calendly</a>),
      etc.</p>
      <p>Skilled users may configure their OS’s default text
      substitution, or install an ad hoc text expander app (e.g. <a
      href="https://espanso.org">espanso</a>, <a
      href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a>, etc.), and
      become lightening fast in sharing the link. Indeed, as soon as I
      type a certain combination of characters (i.e. ;zoom), a specific
      string is automatically replaced
      (e.g. <code>https://blabla.zoom.us/j/blablabla</code>).</p>
      <p>In this way, organising a quick conf-call through instant
      messaging (e.g. Slack, Whatsapp, Teams, etc.), responding to an
      email asking for the link of our scheduled meeting, booking an
      (online) event on my calendar became much faster than launching
      Zoom, creating a new meeting, copy-pasting the link generated,
      etc. Admittedly, the concept of a Personal Meeting Room may not be
      always desirable or completely safe, but so far I rarely created
      ad hoc events in Zoom.</p>
      <h2 id="static-link-to-a-google-meet">Static link to a Google
      Meet?</h2>
      <p>Google Meet does NOT offer the same feature out of the box.
      When creating a new meeting, the user must first navigate to <a
      href="https://meet.google.com/">meet.google.com</a>, press the
      button New Meeting, and then select the desired option from the
      drop down menu, before finally getting to the link to be shared,
      noted, saved, emailed, etc.</p>
      <p>A simple workaround exists: create a daily (recurring) event on
      any Google Calendar. To do so, navigate to <a
      href="https://calendar.google.com/">calendar.google.com</a> and
      then press the plus + button and create a new Event once for all.
      Then choose</p>
      <pre><code>- *Personal Meeting Room*, as title
   - 06:00 - 06:15am, as the event time 
   - daily repeating
   - disable notification
   - show as *Free* time
   - visibility as *Private*
   - **Add Google Meet video conferencing**</code></pre>
      <p>At that point a new link is generated. This link is precious
      and it should be saved somewhere safe. Note that I have chosen a
      time of the day that is not intruding with my real daily schedule.
      I also opted out from any notification. Finally, click on the
      settings of the Google Meet and configure the meeting as you want.
      I have chosen to set</p>
      <pre><code>   - *Host Management* on
   - *Host must join before anyone else*
   - Meeting Access type: *Trusted* (people must ask to join)</code></pre>
      <p>In this way, Google Meet will be like Zoom’s Personal Meeting
      Room default settings.</p>
      <p>Note: The upper limit of a recurring even is 730 occurrences,
      so every two years the link will stop working. The procedure will
      have to be repeated. If you find a trick to go around this
      limitation, let me know.</p>
      <p>I configured my favorite text expander (i.e. espanso) so
      that:</p>
      <pre><code>  - trigger: &quot;;zoom&quot;
    replace: &quot;https://blablabla.zoom.us/j/blablabla&quot;
  - trigger: &quot;;meet&quot;
    replace: &quot;https://meet.google.com/uhuhuhuhu&quot;</code></pre>
      <p>I hope this might be of help.</p>
